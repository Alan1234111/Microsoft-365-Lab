# 👥 Shared Mailbox

A Shared Mailbox is a central email hub used by multiple users to read and send messages from a common address (e.g., info@company.com or support@company.com). Unlike standard mailboxes, these do not have their own username and password—users access them via their personal credentials through delegation.

### 1. Creating the Shared Mailbox

To begin, navigate to the Microsoft 365 Admin Center under Teams & groups > Shared mailboxes.

### 2. Assigning Member Permissions

Once the mailbox is created, you must authorize specific users to access it. There are two primary permission types:

- Read and Manage (Full Access): Allows the user to open the mailbox and view its folders.

- Send As / Send on Behalf: Allows the user to reply to messages using the shared email address.

### 3. Mailbox Mapping

After permissions are granted, the shared mailbox is mapped to the user's account. Microsoft 365's Automapping feature will typically add the mailbox to the user's Outlook profile automatically within 60 minutes. But we can also manually add mailboxes to users
