# 🧩 Creating a user in Office 365

🛠️ I created the users via the GUI, set up a helpdesk template, and assigned the appropriate permissions.

### ✅ Users are issued a temporary random password and flagged to force a password change at first logon.

### ✅ A temporary password has been generated for the user. They must use it for their initial login.

### ✅ Finally, I verified that the user is required to change their password at first logon and confirmed that they are able to sign in to Outlook.
